							<div class="row">
										<P>On the group assignment we developed a parametric come, that jumps every .02 mm in thickness, starting from 2mm (acrylic thickness) +/-  10 steps. </P>
									
										<p>Next to the come, there is also an elongated rectangle. It's ment to be a stick to try out what slot is the material's exact match. </p>

									<p>The end result was the sick matching the <strong>2.18mm</strong> to the thickness of the material (2mm)</p>
									
									<p><strong>A range of 1.8mm to 2.18 mm </strong> With a top right slot that in theory would be 2mm exactly. </p>
									
									<br>
									
									<p>In the group assignment, I was assigned the come its self. Drew it on Solid works and created a parametric 2D drawing. Variables states were: thickness of material, and the variable change. Later used equations referencing both variables, hence, ="t"+(v*2)=2.04mm. </p>

									<p>here is a small fail, that happened testing the parametric feature the drawing took me to make. Apparently some gaps existed i was not aware of.</p>
									
									<p>always make sure everything is properly closed, and have a better grasp on relationships. The SolidWorks has a gap tool that found to be incredibly useful.

									<p>The final parametric design, is explaned in the following pictures in detail. It has 2 variables: 1. MT (material thickness) and 2. V (variable). Its idea is to only enter this 2 parameters and the rest of the dirawing will atumatically proportion is self acordingly. </p>

				<h5  style="color: red;">Square Cut Test</h5>
				<p>The lasercut test is ment to determine the thickness of the material. It is another way to do so. It actually was the first test we did as a group. I took less participation in the drawing portion. As It was required to create a parametric come, it my time was better spent in developing that blueprint. </p>
				<p>In this case, we did multiple tests to see the required speed and laser power required to cut acrylic.</p>
				<p>This test was fully executed by my classmate Ale. We discussed certail concepts as a group, and at the execution time it seemed a better collaboration if everyione tackled a part of the tests and later shared the results. </p>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/laser cutting/lc-group (4).JPG" alt="" /></span>
									</div>
										<p>In this case, the top row was a variation of power, while the bottom row was a variation on speed.</p>
										<p><strong>Power Variation</strong> ranged from 40 to 80 with a constant speed of 60. The far right is a grotesque burnt result while the far left did not fully separate from the mother material. </p>
										<p><strong>Speed Variation</strong> ranged from 10 to 50  while a constant power of 30 was kept. The far right was not fully cut, while the far left barely separated and the material melted all around the edges. </p>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/laser cutting/lc-group (1).JPG" alt="" /></span>
									</div>
						<p>The final Results was a variation of .1mm from the 5 mm Sq. expect to cut.<br> The actual Cut distance was of 4.8mm.<br><strong> Resulting in a laser thickness of .2mm / line= The joint clerance</strong>  </p>
						<p>I'm Already incredibly grateful for teaching us the concept of a thickness of the laser cut. In the past it I have had multiple problems with slight variations in snap fits and cuts dimensions depending on laser cut machanists. It was always a bit uncertain and hard to communicate the uncertainty because I believe its not well understood in most places.  </p>

									<li>Cut something on the vinyl cutter</li>

								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/w4-vynil/1.3.JPG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Here was our first test, and the results with the blade so deep it went though the material and scored the bottom aligning mat as well. As a result we started with a very slim pressure and went onwards, as not to damage anything else. </p>
								</div>
							
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/w4-vynil/settings.JPG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Here are the settings we found to be useful when cutting and engraving reflective vinyl for clothes. It's good information to have handy. </p>

								<p>The following is me after I finally got to work on my vynil cut stamp. "JHC" One I ended stamping on a black hoodie and use often.  </p>

									<p> The vinyl cut, I later realized there was a trasparent paper I was not supose to peal off. So I did cut this again for later placement on my hoodie.  </p>

							<h3>Press-fit Kit - Light bulb screen</h3>
							<p>Press-fit kit concept was developed because I needed something to cover a couple of naked light bulbs in an extra room. The concept was to create something that provides a diffused light, that neatly wraps around a light bulb. </p>
							
							
							
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/laser cutting/cputer/solid modeling lamp pressfit.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The idea was to create this interlocking system of simple shapes that would morph into a larger organic shape that created into a screen around the light bulb and created a much nicer light.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/laser cutting/pressfit/1.11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">

							</div>
							<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/laser cutting/pressfit/1.4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The shapes where intended snap between shapes creating the banana shaped lamp. It was hoverer filled with holes that let the light pass through and the circumference shape did not diminish as expected. It then made me re-evaluate the shapes capabilities and resulted into a experimentation resulting in the later lamp shapes. </p>
							</div>
							<p>The snapping did not work exactly as I planned, but it was enough to create a finning around the light bulb. It was tight enough to hold its own weight and depending on the patten it also created an aesthetically pleasing shape in the day time. </p>

								<h3>To Conclude</h3>
							<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
									<p>Vynil Cutting</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The prodution and use of vynil cutting was mind opening. </li>
									<li>The especific excersise to create a t-shirt stamp was an activity that toped my expectations. I where the hoodie every day. </li>
									<li>But so far beyond the contect of creating a werable, the vynil has far more aplications as is cuttng cardstock and copper. Impresive extentions a simple knive can have used correctly.</li>
									<li>Another surprise was the ease with how the machine, and its software became. We as a collective group where working away with this machine in about hour tops. Most times that is the amount of tine another machine requires to setup and understand its components. </li>
								</ul>
							</div>	
							
							<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
									<p>Laser Cutting</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Lasercutting was an eye opening experiance, as it is a tool commonly used to create prototypes and final products alike. To understand that it cuts with tickness is a majestic realization and creates the ability to use the machine's acuracy to its fullest. </li>
									<li>The machine's aacuracy makes it the most acurate machine I'll evern work with on need to use. Its hard even picturing a 0.018 mm cut.  </li>
									<li>As far as the press-fit kit goes, it did create the expected outcome. A light shade or cover. It was not the way I was expecting it to react, as it was done in a fly. I It was intresting to use this cardboard material as ist's thickness was 18 caliber: about the thickness the laser cut's thickness is. It was a sturdy material that also had an nice translucency creating it a good fit for the kit. </li>
									<li>The lamp shade might be a good fit as far as process goes (leaves a almost no trace of cut). The total area was about 6 A4 papers in aproximately 10 minutes. The cost paper was less than $1, and the cost of cutting time is about $3-5. Creating a $6 lamp shade could be a viable alternative, alternatively an lampshade could be sold $15-18, or more. </li>
