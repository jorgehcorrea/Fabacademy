									<li>In this case I worked on a pcb, where an rn4871 bluetooth module was connected with a attiny 45.</li>
									<li>I had to do a couple of itterations while troubleshooting. Aparently I had ignored the vat connection with the BT module. I had to Improvise, as creating the pcb all over from scratch was not an emediate option. </li>
									<li>I paced to bridges between the outside of the pcb and the current outpuf of the 3.3v transformer. </li>
									<li>I Initially followed the tutorial I found by <a href="http://www.martyncurrey.com/arduino-with-rn48701/">Marthy n currey</a>. It was one of the more complete tutorials to go though. </li>
									<li>I downloaded a Bt scanner to my phone, while the pcb was working, and ment to find it and prove its functional. Unfortunately, In the office I found al least 8 different Bluetooth devices, and not a single had names, or was my pcb. After multiple attempst with: blt scanner and eBacon I decided to look at another option. </li>
									<li>I found the <a herf="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/50002466B.pdf#M6.9.25598.Chapter.Chapter.2.Command.Description">users guide of the RN4871 chip</a>, but first I need to look at how I actually need to do in order to get the chip working. I found the user manual had tons of comands of the presumably language, but noting on how to get the info into the chip. </li>
									<li>Looking over stundes of previous years, specifically from <a href="http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/barcelona/students/joris-navarro/classes/14--networking-and-communications/">Barcelona</a> He points out of important tearms I should get aquinted with. </li>
									<li>So Barcelona sends me to a <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/b/bluetooth-low-energy/posts/ble-services-a-beginners-tutorial">beguiners tutorial for bluetooth</a></li>
									<li>The Generic Attribute Profile or GATT, I interpret is as a metho of packaging the instructions in order to use the product inside. And aparently will be heavy reading!</li>
									<li>Service lookes like mini programs. And predefined services are already created to facilitate certain processes for developers. It would look like understanding and using this should be a must at this point. </li>
									<li>Characteristics: is the area where the actual data exists. Other security and metadata about the informations aparently is also existant in this place.  </li>
									<ul>'An analogy might be a storage room filled with filing cabinets and each filing cabinet has a number of drawers. The GATT profile in this analogy is the storage room. The cabinets are the services, and the drawers are characteristics holding various information. Some of the drawers might also have locks on them restricting the access to its information.' - Martin BL </ul>
									<li>UUID : "t is a unique number used to identify services, characteristics and descriptors, also known as attributes. .. e.g. a peripheral can inform a central what services it provides "</li>
									<li>The  short UUID 16-bit, 0x180D  vs the long 128-bit UUID that transmits so much more custom and detailed stuff. ps. its generated randomly and chances to have to exact long UUID is ~3e-39</li>
									<li>Later looked into the actual pcb I had made, comparing it to the example Neil has and realized that My pcb did not account for FTDI Port. Hence all commands require to go directly to the ATtiny 45 and later pushed into the RN4871 module by a push of the button. As a result I landed on <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication/all">Serial communication description</a></li>
									<li>I figure: "go through the user guide and find what the Attiny 45 needs in order to send a signal to another bluetooth, and hope it is not too long."</li>
