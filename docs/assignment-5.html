									<p>The initial group was a general review about the concept and key points for soldering. As a group and the instructors, we talked about past experience and great tips on soldering. </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Understand that heating too much will brake the pcb useless</li>
										<li>The importance on maintaining cleanliness in the tip, and the proper amount of soldering material (flux) for different components. </li>
										<li>Understand the point where the flux and the soldering material changes from solid to liquid (by surface brightness) and the concept of the surface tension going on that creates a abrasive bond between metal components and a replant action with the pcb's core fibers. </li>
										<li>We later had a hand on tutorial on the subject in order to properly understand. </li>

								<p>On the left we see the 30 deg bit, we used to engrave. On the right we see the 60 deg bit. In this case we used the longer bit in order to cut because the 30 deg bit cuts much thicker line and using it only on copper preserves the edge.  </p>

								<div class="col-12">
								<p>In order to set up the Z-axis, to zero we added a bit of code inside the g-code. This part of code created an electrical close loop when the bit touched the pbc board. Below we see the brass sensonr on top of the pcb board.  </p>

									<p>We did hoverer had to play around plenty in order to get the right milling parameters. Bottom left was too light, bottom right was to deep and top left was the final PCB we cut off and shown under. Mostly we tinkered with the bit's depth from .1-.15. Later modified the bit's  tool diameter: from .1 to .3 and finally to .35. We see the burr as a result of too deep of a cut. </p>

									<p>Here we see the final product: The Line Test.  Unfortunately we did the engraving tests all at once, and then the cutting resulting the cut to be slightly un-aligned with the PCV's engagements. It is still readable. We  are able to see how the <Strong>resolution we managed to get was 2 lines before the .001cm line (white space).</strong> And the thinest coper path was closer to .010 cm. Still very impressive. I doubt that any component we will be using requires such precises and thin connection.   </p>
									<p>In this case the limit of the resolution is dictated acording to the soldering technique of the craft peroson (me) and the components. </p>

								<p>The final cutting parameter where experimented by the group but could not have been proper wihtouht the help of Alex, and his final parameters for each bit. <strong>Super Important</strong> </p>
								<p>After the group assignment, it was individual turn to create our personalized pcb. In my Case, I dedided to initially modify <a href=""> Alex's ISP programer.</a>It all went south when After prepering the png eddition you see on the side, the cutting time came and we realized <strong> the pcb format was x2 bigger.</strong> A simple error in pre-process that hold me back.  </p>
								<p>As a result of this falure, i decided to go and use <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/index.html">Brians Ips - programmer</a> instead as it required 1 less component to salder. And I was getting shorter on time.  </p>

							<p>When I finally got to the production of 1:1 scale pcb, we had some later errors as the pahts of the engraving became too small. Due to the unproper post processing in the <strong>Mods</strong>. Re-processing the image, and inverting the colors at the mod's 1s module the g code was finally ready to cut. What you see on the left is boxed in red the thin paths. Followed by a slight modification that was not enough. Finally we see the ISP proceesor bord. Engraved on it: "Always cheak twice"..

								<h3>To Conclude</h3>
							<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
									<p>Cheaking Twice is not nearly enough. How about like 5 instead?</p>
									<p>It was a wild week's assignment I actually extended it for about 2 -3 weeks more due to unexpected events that happened along the way. From the initial png image all the way into the assembly and later programming portion. I ended building 2 pcb's and tons of wasted time to get a fully functional pcb. When I saw the final: Reading | ########... | 100 %  I knew I was in the right path, but for the final thing to get it to run the <strong> make rstdisbl </strong> at the proper time to make the ISP work was a lot of reading, guidance and especialy saldering involved.   </p>
									<p>So much so that it will be a good idea to have a better understanding what the class might be about before the class starts, to be sharp and actually get assignments on time and not weeks later. </p>
