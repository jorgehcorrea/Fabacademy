									<p>In this section I did a microcontroller to actuate a relay. The final goal being turn on a coffee maker. I measured the output device's in the group assignment, to determine the relay specifications. 7.3 ampers  and 120v.  </p>

								<p>In the beguining I actually created a pcb, without a bluetooth in order to activate the relay via input plugs.

								<p>Inserting the png files into mods. In this case the parameters changed slightly, and documenting it will help me next week for sure. </p>
								<p>At the same time I did this experiment I thought was neat and safer to work with when using 120v 7amp power. First in Eagle, I gave the 120v footprints a 100 mil wide path. I later edited this paths to have their own png file, and g code so as to add multiple offsets only arround them. Saving myself tons of time.  </p>
								<p>The way I look at it is if I do require to fix or make another pcb, by making the minimun amount of offsets, Ill have more time for all this debug that will surely exist. As for example: Out of line line. </p>

								<p>I found this out of line lines (shown on the left), and had to go back a recreate the g code. I found them while placeing the machining operation in the nc - viewer online.</p>
								<p> I also found this line that most lightly mods was picking up from the edge of the image (shown in the right). In the later case I just stoped the cnc machine before it started cutting that line, as it was at the end of the g-code.  </p>
								<p>On the right what you are seeing is a conglomerate of all the g-codes into a single file. I do this because I cannot add multiple files to the nc-viewer online. It is also helpfull to see that everything lines up <strong>Before</strong> actually machining them all. </p>

								<p>Above is the pcb I ended machining. With the extra offsets only on the 120v paths, a couple of mounting holes on the sides. And names on everything as to instantly communicate what is going on. We have the technology.</p>
								<p> The time it takes machining greatly outweight the possible little mistake that might burn the microcontroller.  </p>

								<p>I was having trouble with the pcb, and didnt realize that I connected the mosfet wrong. I also did not provide power to the bluetooth. Corrected by alex, I did some hands on engine repair and with a bit of luck I managed to get everything conected and working. Still ogly thoug.</p>

								<p>I also had to switch the relay, as the original one I solder just didnt work. And those 5 pis where hell to brake loose. As a result all the salder material all over. Bit more and could have sold it as a "chrome" pcb. Also, the relay broke while unsoldering one leg. </p>

									<p>I measured the current going through an outlet into the  Coffee Maker. In order for it to give a proper value of the resistance, I added water and actually brewed coffee.. for learning purposes of course. </p>
									<p>And so I started with a certain left turn. It was a turning point when I attemped to measure the Ohm's between each outlet plug. </p>

									<p>This all equates to realizing that my relay, to turn on and off the coffee maker must be just as strong as the coffee its brewing. As it the heating element is basically a gigantinc resistance that mostly emits heat when current runs through, it require a large energy. </p>

									<p>From this assignment, I was able to create several connections to my final project as well as literal debugging conections. Actually drink my warm coffee semi-autonomously made, was bittersweet. An i would do it all the time.</p>
									<p>It did require tons of debugging, so as a mental note I will make most of the bits and parts polished enough just to be jouint in a final week. </p>
