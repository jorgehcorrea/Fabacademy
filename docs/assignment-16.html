								<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
									

<p> For the individual assignment we defined that the interface would be done with <strong> MIT app Inventor </strong> in combination with a bluetooth input/ output device. </p>
<p>The componets:
<ul>
<li>Phone (android)</li>
<li>HC-05 Bluetooth Module</li>
<li>PCB Board (Mutant fish board)</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>I was surprised with the ease with which the front end system could be created.  For exercise sake I decided to create a gif out of the process, partly as a excersise to create a gif and partly because actually uploading the complete images makes for a content less essay. </p>

<p>Gif!</p>
<div class="col-12 ">
<span class="image main"><img src="images/w16_Applications/mit app inventor.gif" alt="" /></span>
</div>
<p> In the end we had a .apk file for uploading into the phone. </p>

<p>It all sounded too good to be true, and so it was when we realized I had a iPhone and the application is not existent as it is on android &quot;playstore&quot;.  Apparently there is a movement, development where the Mit app inventor app launching and as we speak on the beta phase. In order to access it however I required to fill in a formulae and be considered an option for the testing. Maybe they will find a amateur developer as an interesting focuse group? </p>

<p>So a quick search in google showed other options to actually work with iPhone.  I later attempted to make it work with a similar application on the web called: <strong>Thunkable</strong></p>
<div class="col-12 ">
<span class="image main"><img src="images/w16_Applications/thunkable.png" alt="Playing arround with Thnukable app development environment" /></span>
</div>
<p>  Only to find that the system did not have a direct Bluetooth support. Because i will be using Bluetooth, in the entirety and have thought that it will be an integral part of the fab project, I require to figure out how to use it. That was enough to make me searching again for another app developer, preferably in blocks. Reviewing the Thunkable Platform, it was very similar to the MIT app inventor. Almost as if it was the same thing, with the added note of some textures and a few changed options, as was the Bluetooth one. At least its connectivity option was not offering Bluetooth. </p>

<p>Later found <strong>AppyBuilder</strong>, an app building system that d id support Bluetooth, and started hacking away at it. </p>
<div class="col-12 ">
<span class="image main"><img src="images/w16_Applications/appystore.png" alt="playing arround with appybuilder app development environment" /></span>
</div>
<p>Again a super similar feeling, that I thought it might be a bit to easy to work it out. Hence I thought maybe a bit more reaserch on how to add it into the iphone would work. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Apparently I have to download xcode, for the iPhone. Looking for it in the app store was only downloading tutorials.</p>



<p> It was not downloading the actual app. A forum later attributed to downloading mac store, and so I did but another search revealed there is nothing to work with. </p>

<p>Maybe because I am in Ecuador, as the appstore it wont just let me download the app?. After some reaserch I can sign in under: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/"> https://developer.apple.com/ </a> but by the time I figured this out it was much to late to actually learn "their way" of coding stuff. </p>


<p>In the end I figure It might be best to just use the android platform. So I will use that instead.  </p>
<p>So I did, I used a borrowe android in order to upload an app. </p>

<p>The anoying white cable was actually just charging the phone. In highnsite, I should have not shown it as part of the video, as it is confusing. </p>

								<h3>To Conclude</h3>
							<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
								<p>I fond this week chalenging, not because it was a very complex and difficult assignment, but as a result of it building on top of earlier assignments. The: me having and Iphone, and attempt to make it work also ate too much of my time. Based on the idea that I have not enough experiance on the development side of the app things. </p>
									<p>I still found it very strange that there was very little referede to the iphone app development in the fabacademy (in my search) at the same time apple is already a propietery alternative that translates into their full power over the development of software and that can create changes and work lost for internal policies no developer will be fond of. </p>
									<p>In the future I will be integrating the bluetooth as part of my final project. Something to be planning ahead, as I'm intially planning to use the rn4871 bluetooth module, instead of the hc-05 module. The reason because i did not run it this week was because I have not got an ftdi or serial cable to communicate directly, making the operation more complex than this one.</p>
