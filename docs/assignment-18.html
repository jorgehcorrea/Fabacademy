						<h3>Intelelctual license</h3>			
						<p>Int his case I belive the license I would use, that is congruent with my personal belives is the <strong>Attribution 4.0 International</strong></p>	
						<p>From my perspective, if somebody wants to learn something they should. I think even with al this vast internet shared knowladge it is still hard to find specific specialised information and shareing it is the best way to move forawrd. So why to activly give the tools for it.  </p>
						<p>Its like if somebody asks for my help to learn something, I cant stop everything I'm doing to teach them but I'll give them pointer, tips and a path to follow and learn just as it has been given to me. </p>
						<p>It becomes a case of reciprocity and I think taking on that resposability is a must in every scenario, where somebody shows the aptitude or intrest of actually wanting to learn. So I figure give it openly is best. </p>
						<p>Sidenote: If you see projects that thrive and grow in a community is always a faster growth when its open and available to mix and match openly. Android is an excelent example of it, the fab itself is another. </p>

						<h3>Develop a plan for dissemination of your final project</h3>
							<p>A fully and functional dissemination plan is not possible at this stage, as the project might require some more finishing. </p>
							<p>I,the first step might be to refinish the cushion by redoing the process or furnishing it with another material. After so, possibly uploading it to behance as a method of acquiring feedback from a design savvy crowed.   </p>
							<p>The current files could also be uploaded to various platforms in order to receive feedback on the chair design and possibly gain some insight not corrupted my personal opinion. </p>

							<p>If a third party validation on the furniture is successful maybe I'm on to something? <a href="https://makezine.com/2014/03/18/open-source-furniture-2/">I was also inspired by an article my "make:" magazine talking about open cnc furniture</a></p>

									<h3>Future possibilities: </h3>
							<p>Possible future outcomes that could be interesting to me are developing the system future in order for it to actually have a closed loop when creating coffee. Silvia Lugo (class mate in TECSUP Peru) has inspired me into rethinking my approach into coffee making. Possibly attempting to create a coffee machine in the future. Cause It sounds fun, and I'm jelous of her coffe machine, cause it looks like great work.  </p>
							<p>Application for the chair have been brainstormed arround in the lab. <br> 1. creating a chair to select the beverage you desire <br> 2. Add a capacitive sensing as a time management device to a chair, possibly even in large industries<br> 3.Further develop smart chair systems that actually help your computer turn on and automatically load your working applications/ calender/ to-do lists and stuff.<br> 4. Integrating the system for good posture in a chair seating and even time defined loop cycles as "the pomodoro technique" proposes.   </p>
							<p>Possibly dive into the time management application of the aspect so as to later actually get the rest of the possibilities done might be great advice? Besides very fiew people have a strong grasp on time management and hence might appeal to a wider market. </p>

								<h3>Draft Slide</h3>
										<div class="col-12">
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/w21/lense_flare.jpg" alt="image draft final slide"/> </span>
										<p>In this case the picture, (taken my Ale) was already preselected and eddited. Especially the coffee glow, is how i see it every morning. </p>
										<p>Some lense flare adding tutorial was in order <a href="https://www.photoshopessentials.com/photo-effects/how-to-add-lens-flare-to-an-image-with-photoshop/"> you can cheak out here</a> just dont over do it, like i might have.</p>
										</div>
										
								<h3>Draft Video</h3>
									<div class="col-12">
																<video width="100%" controls muted>
																<source src="presentation.mp4" type="video/ogg" />
																</video>
															</div>
								<p>The earlier draft had no music, I'm just muting the later jazz version to compare the difference.</p>
								<p></p>
							<hr class="major"/>
							<h3>Imagined and outlined possibilities and described how to make them probabilities</h3>
								<p>Imagining:</p>
								<p>A Vacuum Coffee maker, using 2 500ml lab flasks, and having a direct connection to the water supply system. The bottom flask is heated to boil with an electric element.  With a direct water supply system the coffee machine could automatically fill up with water and auto-clean it self. </p>
								<p>Additionally a coffee reservoir could dispense grounded coffee powder via a screw device, placing new coffee every time. </p>

								<p>I think there are enough users that could consider the coffee machine static appliance as is a sink or kitchen stoves.</p>
								
								<p>Coffee has had such a big impact in today's society, and it is reflected on the amount of starbucks, bridgeheads or Juan Valdez coffee shops, not to mention independent ventures (my fav ever black squirrel coffee shop in Ottawa) that done right this appliance would surely fund a kickstarter / indigogo campaign, unless some corporate appliance like kitchen aid would like adopt it. I mean, smart fridges are becoming old now, so could smart coffee be next? I imagine so.  </p>
