									<ul>
									<li><strong>What will it do?</strong></li>
									<td>It will produce coffee at the que of a person seating on the chair in the morning.</td>
									<br>
									<td>A deeper look into it, It will be composed of two different systems: </td><br><br>
										<ul>
										<strong>Chair System</strong>
										<li>1.The first system will be embeded inside the chair.  It will have a simple swithc to detect if something is on it. It will will later turn on a capacitive sensor where it will determine if there is a person or if its something lese like books or a bag.</li>
										<li>1.1 If its a person, it will make sure the time of day is morning, with an internal timer. It will also cheak if its the first time, if it is not it will do nothing. </li>
										<li>1.2 If all is true, then it will send a signal via bluetooth to the output (the coffee maker pcb). </li>
										<li>1.3 After sending the signal it will count the signal sent. In case the person sits again in the same time period it will not sent this again.</li>
										<li>1.4 15 min afer the signal is sent the chair system will signal to the human that the coffee should be ready. (not sure by what means yet.)</li>
								
										</ul>
										<ul>
										<strong>Coffee System</strong>
										<li>2. The system starts with a signal from the "Chair system" Where system 1 sends a signal via bluetooth to make coffee.</li>
										<li>2.1 The system will in turn send a signal from the buetooth to the Attiny 45 to turn on the relay.</li>
										<li>2.2 The Attiny will turn the relay with a 5v charge.</li>
										<li>2.3 The Relay (already hacked into the coffee machine) will turn the drip coffee machine on. </li>
										<li>2.4 The machine will take about 15 min to make coffee. </li>
										</ul>
									<li><strong>Who's done what beforehand?</strong></li>
									<ul>
									<li><a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/376/finalproj.html">The cube -  An intetgrated tables, chair and light </a></li>
									<li><a href="https://commoncubes.wixsite.com/home"> Commin Cubes</a></li>
									<li><a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/07/lift-bit-furniture-system-internet-of-things-carlo-ratti-for-vitra-milan-design-week-2016/"> Carlo Ratti's Iot Sofa</a></li>
									
									</ul>
									<li><strong>What will you design?</strong></li>
									<li>I will design the electronics behind both (The chair and coffee system) systems, and the chair. Currently I have a rocking chair that is operational and being finished. If time permits I would like to create another chair, But the main tasks will be to connect the chair with the coffe machine.</li>
									<li><strong>What materials components will be used?</strong></li>
									<li>The materials used, are the ones we will be using through out this course. Things like 15mm ply wood, resin based pcb with standard attiny /atmega components, 3d printed inserts to make it look finished and all this good stuff. Its highly lightly that to finish off the pcb covers I'll use 3D printing as well</li>
									<li><strong>Where will come from?</strong></li>
									<li>What I have has already came from the fab academy's previous assignments. As was the plywood chair. It still requires some more work to finish and a ligth treatment to have it look finished. The filament for the covers have been pla plastic, that, depending on the finial project's covers most lightly run on my part. The microcontrollers and bluetooth moduiles have run on part of the fab academy as well as all electronics, and unless I require a very specialized or very common part (something I dont forsee in the future) Im close to have it all electornics in place already. </li>
									<li>They will mostly be from the fab lab. </li>
									<li><strong>How much will they cost?</strong></li>
										The following are aproximates thrown to the wind, of the cost we are talking about. 
										<ul>
											<li>Generic 15mm Plywood 1.22x2.44 $30 - If time allows cutting a chair in plywood veniered sheet.($65)   </li>
											<li>Generic Coffee Mahcine $30</li>
											<li>x2 Bluetooth modules $14</li>
											<li>Attiny 45 $3</li>
											<li>Atmega 88 $4.5</li>
											<li>SMD Electronic aditionals $10</li>
											<li>120v - 10 amp / 5v Relay $ 1.5</li>
											<li>1 Rol of PLA 3D Pinting $25 </li>
											<li>Rough estimate =<strong> $153 total</strong></li>
										</ul>
									<li><strong>What part and systems will be made?</strong></li>
									<li></li>
									<li><strong>What processes will be used?</strong></li>
									<li>1. Cnc Cutting wood for the chair</li>
									<li>2. Cnc Machining PCB boards (Chair and Coffee machine systems)</li>
									<li>3. Soldering the system</li>
									<li>4. 3D printing for the cases in each system</li>
									<li>5. Casting for the details of the joints and possibly a biopolimer for the seat. </li>
									<li>6. The application portion of the project is still being brainstomed, yet a close is to use the application to porgram the initial parameters for the chair / coffee machine to make coffee. </li>

									<li><strong>What questions need to be answered?</strong></li>
									<li>06/05/2019<br> 
									What will the aplication actually do? set up time blocks between wich to drink coffee as in.. are you an nigth owl or a early riser? set the time and date of the device, can in be pared with the phones automatically? Set how much coffees would you require to repete?  <br> 
									What will the best use of casting be for this project? to add to the details and therefore its price<br> 
									Will the Coffee system require a timer, and if so how will it be put in place?<br>
									Will the capacitive sensor be enough to actually activate the coffee machine system?<br>
									
									</li>
									<li><strong>How will it be evaluated?</strong></li>
									<li>In this case it is always a tad subjective, yet if After seating the system makes me coffee Its a defenate success. I will hold no gurdge if this happens at midnight.<br> In order for this to happen, Im thinking it requires the capacitive sensor to be working, the communications of bluetooth working, and at the very least the relay. To mantain the time correct, it also requires the timer to be set up properly. I It looks like this project will be a work or not type of scenario as everything is very reachable one the threshold is met.    </li>
